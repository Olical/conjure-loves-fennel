= Conjure LÖVEs Fennel

A minimal example of using https://github.com/Olical/conjure[Conjure] to interactively develop a https://www.lua.org/[Lua] game using https://fennel-lang.org/[Fennel] the https://love2d.org/[LÖVE] engine.

== Requirements

Ensure you have all of the following installed via your system package manager or https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug[Neovim plugin manager].

 * https://love2d.org/[LÖVE] (system)
 * https://neovim.io/[Neovim] (0.4+) (system)
 * https://github.com/Olical/conjure[Conjure] (plugin)
 * https://github.com/Olical/nvim-local-fennel[nvim-local-fennel] for project local configuration (plugin)

== Usage

To begin interacting with the project, simply open `game.fnl` and get evaluating!

The `:ConjureSchool` can be used to learn how to evaluate things with Conjure.

== Acknowledgements

The `stdio.fnl` is from https://gitlab.com/alexjgriffith/min-love2d-fennel[alexjgriffith/min-love2d-fennel], I would never have been able to work that part out on my own. It allows the engine to start up, boot a Fennel REPL over stdio and continue running without waiting for the Fennel REPL to exit.
